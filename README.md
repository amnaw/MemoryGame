# Memory Game

This Project is the second project from Udacity Front End Nandodegree program.
and it is all about demonstrating my skills of JavaScript. 
It’s a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a shnazzy, well-designed, feature-packed memory game!
The game board consists of sixteen cards in a grid.

### Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying image.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same image.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
